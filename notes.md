dont give me any code, Im creating a word processor using contenteditable. this does not hold any state of the document, should i be using a data strcuture to track the current state of the document? in case i need to check things backwards?

Yes — you're absolutely right to think about tracking the state.

Using `contentEditable` gives you direct DOM manipulation, but **it doesn’t naturally preserve structured state**. If you're building a real word processor (even a basic one), and you want features like:

* undo/redo
* formatting detection
* cursor-based logic
* selective formatting (bold, font size, etc.)
* consistent rendering across browsers

…then **you need a separate data structure** to represent the current document state.

### Why use a data structure:

* Lets you **abstract away** from the messy DOM.
* You can build a **tree**, a **list of blocks**, or even a **text + formatting range** model (like a `TextRun` system).
* Enables smarter features: formatting history, document saving, diffing, etc.

You don’t need something overly complex at first — but **yes**, introducing your own structure to represent and track the document content is the scalable approach.

Let me know if you want a breakdown of the common structures used in word processors.

---------

is each word a node on the tree?

Each word is not usually a node — unless you're building something extremely granular. Instead:

Most document models treat paragraphs or text runs (sections with shared formatting) as nodes.

Words are typically just part of a string inside a node, not separate nodes themselves.

Typical structure:
Imagine a document like this:

Hello world.

You might represent it like:
Document
├── Paragraph
│   ├── TextRun: "Hello "
│   └── TextRun: "world" (bold)

nginx
Copy
Edit
Document
├── Paragraph
│   ├── TextRun: "Hello "
│   └── TextRun: "world" (bold)
Paragraph is a block node.

Each TextRun holds a chunk of text with consistent formatting.

Words are inside the TextRun.text.


--------------
how many word are typically held in  a textrun?

A TextRun contains as many words as possible until the formatting changes.

| Text                       | Bold? | # of TextRuns |
| -------------------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| `This is a sentence.`      | No    | 1             |
| `This is a **bold** word.` | Mixed | 3             |


In documents without much styling, TextRuns can span full sentences or paragraphs.

In stylized documents (like marketing copy or design-heavy text), TextRuns can be as short as a single word or even a single character (e.g., for custom coloring or emphasis).

----------------
so i will have to build something like ascanner/parser for this project?


To build a word processor (even a basic one) that can understand, track, and manipulate content in a structured way, you’ll end up implementing something very similar to a scanner and parser, even if informally.

Here’s how that maps to your project:

🔍 SCANNER (Lexical analyzer equivalent)
You need to break raw text into meaningful tokens, such as:

Words

Spaces

Line breaks

Formatting markers (like bold, italic, etc.)

Punctuation

You might scan text from the DOM and turn it into a list of "runs" or "nodes" you track in memory.
